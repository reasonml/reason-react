/** this is marked as "dangerous" because you technically shouldn't be accessing the URL outside of watchUrl's callback;
      you'd read a potentially stale url, instead of the fresh one inside watchUrl.

      But this helper is sometimes needed, if you'd like to initialize a page whose display/state depends on the URL,
      instead of reading from it in watchUrl's callback, which you'd probably have put inside didMount (aka too late,
      the page's already rendered).

      So, the correct (and idiomatic) usage of this helper is to only use it in a component that's also subscribed to
      watchUrl. Please see https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example/blob/master/src/todomvc/TodoItem.re
      for an example.
