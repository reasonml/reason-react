title: ReasonReact is back (and powered by Melange)
---

ReasonReact moved to `@rescript/react` after the ReScript announcement. The future of ReasonReact has been uncertain ever since. In the meantime, the Melange team announced the first major release of [Melange](https://anmonteiro.substack.com/p/melange-10-is-here) and took the first steps towards deeper integration with the OCaml ecosystem.

Today, we are happy to announce that ReasonReact is back and will be maintained by the Melange team going forward.

## What's changing?

We released ReasonReact to the [opam repository](https://ocaml.org/p/reason-react/latest). In the Melange docs, we document [how to depend](https://melange.re/v1.0.0/package-management/) on packages in opam.

We updated the documentation to reflect these new changes and we will continue to improve it over time.

## Full changelog

The version of ReasonReact published to npm is compatible with ReScript 0.9.0. Since then, we've fixed a few things:

- [0.9.2] Add drag event API binding
- [0.9.2] Add `aria-haspopup` as ariaHaspopup as prop
- [0.9.2] Add `aria-current` as ariaCurrent as prop
- [0.9.2] Add `aria-checked` as ariaChecked as prop
- [0.10.0] Deprecate legacy modules (ReasonReact, ReasonReactCompat, ReasonReactOptimizedCreateClass)

### Version 0.11

- [0.11.0] Add suppressHydrationWarning
- [0.11.0] Created opam package (reason-react.opam)
- [0.11.0] Requires dune 3.8.0 (via dune-project)
- [0.11.0] Full migration to Melange

## Adopting ReasonReact

To use ReasonReact, you must be using Melange. [Get started here](https://melange.re/v1.0.0/getting-started/).

Next:

- Install the latest version of ReasonReact: `opam install reason-react`
- Use this as a package in the dune file `(libraries reason-react)` (make sure to add `(preprocess (pps react-jsx-ppx))` as well).
- Replace usages of modules with their newer names: `ReactDOMRe` -> `ReactDOM`, `ReactEventRe` -> `ReactEvent`, `ReasonReact` -> `React`.
- Remove usages of `ReasonReactCompat` and `ReasonReactOptimizedCreateClass`. They were deprecated a long time ago, and we removed them in this version.

## Future

We started moving all ReasonReact related packages to Melange and 0.11 and want to make sure the ReasonML community can update the 3rd party libraries to use Melange as well.

Some of them are published in [github.com/melange-community](https://github.com/melange-community/) or [github.com/ahrefs](https://github.com/ahrefs) such as [https://github.com/ahrefs/melange-react-dates](melange-react-dates) or [melange-recharts](https://github.com/ahrefs/melange-recharts).

There's lots to do for the next version. We are committed to continue improving ReasonReact and make it a great library for the Melange and ReasonML community. In the future, we expect to make the following changes:

- Track `reacjs-jsx-ppx` in this repository, and rename it to `reason-react-ppx`, a more suitable name
- Use the [new JSX transform](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) from React 17
- Fix code-generation locations for JSX and props
- Continue improving the documentation

Feel free to reach out if you have any feedback. You can [open an issue](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/issues) in this repository, or join the [ReasonML Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml).

Have a good day!
