title: ReasonReact 0.5: Fragment, Event, Cleanups
---

It's been a while since the last blog post! Note that we've been updating ReasonReact, just that we didn't want to drown you with too many blog posts when unnecessary. As we've said in our [ReasonConf video](https://twitter.com/reasonconf/status/1002152653718245376), we wanted the ReasonReact community to catch up and settle down a bit before showering it with another batch of changes.

As usual, the proper list of changes are in [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/main/HISTORY.md#050), likewise for the [migration script](https://github.com/chenglou/upgrade-reason-react#installation). Major highlights:

- Fragment support.
- `ReactEventRe` -> `ReactEvent` revamp.
- General cleanups that removes a bunch of already deprecated features.

There are also many other quality-of-life improvements that, combined together, should reduce the arbitrary newcomer frictions in some places.

See you next time!
