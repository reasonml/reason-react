title: ReasonReact 0.9.0 - Uncurried and Code Cleanup
---

Release 0.9.0 is primarily to setup for larger changes in coming BuckleScript and ReasonReact release, but that's not all that's there. Exciting new features include `React.Uncurried` hooks which provide even cleaner JS output and better performance for hooks that get called in hot loops. Additionally we now have better support for `Strict` mode, `ErrorBoundaries`, and pointer events.

There are two breaking changes which most people are unlikely to hit:

1. We have stopped versioning lib/js and will not ship on NPM. If you are using this library from Reason you will be unaffected. If you're using directly from handwritten JS, you could run into issues. If you want to continue doing this, you can `include` the code you're using into a Reason file in your codebase where you have more control over how it is exposed.
2. We have changed the APIs of some of the `ReactDOM.Experimental` namespace. As the namespace implies, this code is not intended for production app use and you likely will not notice any difference here.
