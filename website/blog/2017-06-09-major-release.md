title: Major New Release!
---

0.1.4 is released! We've got a new documentation website here, a brand new ReasonReact API, a smooth migration guide, and best of all: **no breaking change**! Head over to [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/main/HISTORY.md#014) for the incremental migration.

<!--truncate-->

This is a very exciting release for us. We've been working on it while taking into account the external and internal folks' feedback. The new API should feel very, very familiar to users of ReactJS. The previous API's corner-cases are gone too. In short: improvements across the board (API, codegen, type safety, speed, familiarity, etc.).

As always, we're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml) if you need any help!
