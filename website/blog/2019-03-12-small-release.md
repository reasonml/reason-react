title: ReasonReact 0.6.0 (Small Release)
---

Hello! It's been a while. We've been heads down working on a few secret features these days; in the meantime, hopefully you enjoyed the stability of the API so far.

We're making a tiny release today to improve some nits. Consider this blog post as a heart beat. Don't forget to come to [Reason Conf](https://www.reason-conf.com)! We have some ReasonReact stuff to share with you there.

As usual, release notes are [here](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/main/HISTORY.md#060). No migration script this time; it's just a single letter change.
