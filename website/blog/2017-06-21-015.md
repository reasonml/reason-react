title: 0.1.5 Released
---

Thanks for the wait! Head over to [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/main/HISTORY.md#015) to see the changes. This is a small non-breaking release, though we did fix a ref-related issue that can cause type errors. The fix is trivial; see the notes.

We've batched together non-breaking features for your upgrading convenience. Next version will be a breaking one, with API tweaks that fix some of the existing pain points. Stay tuned!
