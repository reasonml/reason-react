title: What & Why
---

ReasonReact is a safer, simpler way to build [React](https://reactjs.org/) components, in [Reason](http://reasonml.github.io/).

By leveraging the latter's great type system, expressive language features and smooth interoperability with JS, ReasonReact packs ReactJS' features into an API that is:

- Safe and statically typed
- Simple and lean
- Familiar and easy to insert into an existing ReactJS codebase
- Well thought-out (made by the creator of ReactJS himself!)

It is often said that writing ReactJS code feels like "just using JavaScript". The same applies to ReasonReact, but we push it further; writing routing, data management, component composition and components themselves feel like "just using Reason".
