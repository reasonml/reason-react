title: I Really Need Feature X From ReactJS
---

First make sure that you indeed can't achieve this idiom using the latest version of reason-react. If you need help figuring out how to translate a certain idiom, feel free to ask us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/reasonml). If it is not achievable with reason-react, you can always write the component in ReactJS first, then bind to it using [our interop](components.md#interop). Try to isolate the required functionality into a tiny ReactJS component and write the rest of your code in reason-react. Once this is done, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/issues) explaining your use case!
