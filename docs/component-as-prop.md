title: Component as Prop
---

In ReactJS, `<Menu banner={MyBanner} />` is easy; in reason-react, we can't trivially pass the whole component module (it wouldn't even be syntactically valid because a module resides in [another layer of the language](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/module.html)). Solution:

```reason
let bannerCallback = (prop1, prop2) => <MyBanner message=prop1 count=prop2 />;

<Menu bannerFunc=bannerCallback />;
```

This also has some added advantages:

- The _owner_ is the one controlling how the component renders, not some opaque logic inside `MyBanner`.
- Circumvents the tendency of needing a [props spread](props-spread.md) in `MyBanner`'s render, since passing a component to a child and the child using prop spread on said component usually go together.
