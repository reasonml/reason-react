title: Installation
---

ReasonReact is built to work with [Melange](https://melange.re/) and [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/). This installation guide will help you get started.

If you want to build a new app or a new website with ReasonReact and Melange, we recommend to use a package manager such as [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) to download and install the required dependencies.

There are other alternatives available, such as [esy](https://esy.sh/) or [nix](https://nixos.org/). See [Melange documentation](https://melange.re/v1.0.0/getting-started/#alternative-package-managers-experimental) for details.

#### Requirements

- [melange](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/melange) v1.0.0 or higher
- [dune](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/dune/) v3.8.0 or higher

## Melange

Melange is the toolchain that compiles Reason and OCaml to JavaScript. It integrates with dune to provide a seamless experience for building and running your project.

Follow the getting started guide on [Melange's documentation](https://melange.re/v1.0.0/getting-started/) to continue.

## Editor Setup

Since Reason is an alternative syntax for OCaml, we integrate seamlessly into the official OCaml editor toolchain. Following the recommendation from [Melange's documentation](https://melange.re/v1.0.0/getting-started/#editor-integration).

- For VSCode, we recommend using the [vscode-ocaml-platform](https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform) plugin
- For other editors (Emacs and Vim), we recommend using a language server client plugin of your choice, and pairing it with [ocaml-lsp](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp).

### Using the template

[Melange opam template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-opam-template) comes with the minimum required to build a ReasonReact application with all dependencies up-to-date and ready.

The `.re`/`.ml` files compile to straightforward `.js` files inside your `_build` folder. You can open `index.html` directly from the file system. No server needed! Change any file to see that page automatically refreshed.

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/melange-re/melange-opam-template my-reason-react-app

# This will initialise the opam switch and install all the dependencies (from both opam and npm)
cd my-reason-react-app && make init
# We install native dependencies (melange, dune, reason and reason-react) from opam
# while JavaScript dependencies (react, react-dom, webpack) from npm

# In separate terminals:
make watch # It will watch for changes in your Reason/OCaml files and compile them to JavaScript
make serve # Serves the application with a local HTTP server
```

Read more about the template in the [opam-template README](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-opam-template).

### Adding Reason to an existing React.js Project (Create React App, Next.js, etc.)

Set up manually is straight forward. Install native dependencies, add some scripts and create a `dune` file.

1. Install the following dependencies in your opam switch with

```sh
opam install melange dune reason reason-react reactjs-jsx-ppx -y
```

2. Enable melange inside dune under a `dune-project` file in the root of your project with the following:
```sh
(lang dune 3.8)
(using melange 0.1)
```

Check [dune docs](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/melange.html) for all fields available.

3. Create a `dune` file in the source of your Reason code with the following content:

```dune
(melange.emit
  (target melange) ; or any target name you want
  (libraries reason-react)
  (preprocess (pps reactjs-jsx-ppx)))
```

The target name is the name of the folder where the compiled code will live and also an "alias" to run the build commands (see below).

4. Run those commands to build your code:

```sh
# "@melange" is an alias created automatically from the target field in the dune file
opam exec -- dune build @melange
# or if you want to watch for changes
opam exec -- dune build @melange --watch
```

All compiled code will live under `_build/default/{{target_name}}` folder with the same structure as your source code.
