Note that we've been updating ReasonReact, just that we didn't want to drown you with too many blog posts when unnecessary.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>0.3.0 is here! We've bumped the minor version because it's a breaking change (just a small one, see <a href="https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/master/HISTORY.md#030">HISTORY.md</a>. We've been <em>really</em> careful with breaking changes). Stay tuned for more exciting features coming in the next few weeks (non-breaking). In th...</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>v0.2.4 was done in collaboration with the ReactJS team</em>.</p>
<p>This is a release we've been planning for quite a while now, and is one that embodies what the Reason team is trying to achieve through ReasonReact.</p>
<p>First, a bit of context: if you use ReactJS, then you've likely heard of the the massively popular <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux/">Redux</a> state management library. Redux's original inspiration comes from <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>, whose root we share.</p>
