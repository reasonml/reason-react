### Welcome to the source of ReasonReact

We want to expose the minimum amount of top-level modules possible, and at the same time want to map closely to the npm packages. So each module maps to a npm package, and each sub-module maps to a sub-module. For example: `react-dom` -> `ReactDOM` and `react-dom/server` -> `ReactDOMServer`.

Files overview:

## Bindings

- `React`: bindings to React
  - `React.Event`: bindings to React's custom events system
  - `React.Context`: bindings to React's Context
- `ReactDOM`: bindings to ReactDOM
  - `ReactDOM.Style`: bindings to create `style` objects
- `ReactDOMServer`: bindings to ReactDOMServer
- `ReactDOMTestUtils`: helpers for testing your components

## Extra (not part of react)
- `ReasonReactErrorBoundary`: component to catch errors within your component tree
- `ReasonReactRouter`: a simple, yet fully featured router with minimal memory allocations

Eventually `ReasonReactErrorBoundary` and `ReasonReactRouter` could live into their own packages, but for now they are part of ReasonReact (and we will keep them here for backwards compatibility).
