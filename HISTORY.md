# 0.7.1

Small release with a couple additional bindings to existing React APIs.

New APIs:
* `React.cloneElement`
* `React.Children`
* `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useImperativeHandle` now are all consistently implemented up to `useX7` to improve usability.
* `ReasonReactRouter.urlNotEqual`

Also removes `.cm*` generated files from the release to clean up the build process.

# 0.7.0

Support for [React Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Allows for writing function components with state and complex interactions.

You can now write components like

```reason
[@react.component]
let make = (~className, ~text) => <div className> {text} </div>;
```

which will compile to a 0-cost React component that looks like

```js
let make = ({className, text}) => <div className> {text} </div>;
```

These components use a new PPX shipped with BuckleScript 5.0.0+. Please read the documentation for more.

There is no breaking change here, but if you're interested in migrating some components the upgrade script is [provided](https://github.com/rickyvetter/upgrade-reason-react#installation). It will wrap existing ReasonReact components as if they are Hooks components.


# 0.6.0

Mini release before a surprise release next time (shhhhh) =).

## Breaking

- The DOM prop `crossorigin` is now correctly named `crossOrigin`. This is a tiny breaking change, thus the version bump (#290).

## Improvements

- Fix issue with react-hot-loader (#298).
- `ReasonReact.Router.replace` to replace state.

# 0.5.0

**This release requires `bs-platform 4.0.3`**.

Small breaking change (only if you haven't upgraded for a while). **The migration/upgrade script**, as always, is [here](https://github.com/chenglou/upgrade-reason-react#installation).

## Event Changes

`ReactEventRe` is now deprecated in favor of `ReactEvent`. They're similar but the latter comes with the big quality-of-life improvement of turning our old:

```reason
ReactDOMRe.domElementToObj(ReactEventRe.Form.target(event))##value
```

into:

```reason
event->ReactEvent.Form.target##value
```

Aka, you can use the `->` fast pipe now (`|.` in OCaml syntax), and we've changed the definition of `target` in the various `ReactEvent` modules to directly give you back a `Js.t` object instead of `Dom.element`. Same applies to other such attributes.

We've also changed things like `ReactEventRe.Mouse._type` into `ReactEventRe.Mouse.type_` to abide by the Reason idiom.

Lastly, `bs.send.pipe` is informally deprecated, so we've removed the usage of those too. Instead of `e |> ReactEventRe.Mouse.preventDefault`, use either `e->ReactEvent.Mouse.preventDefault` or `ReactEvent.Mouse.preventDefault(e)`. `bs.send.pipe` is, all things considered, the **heaviest** BuckleScript special annotation. If your library uses it, please consider removing it too. Thanks!

## JSX

**Fragment** has landed! `<> child1 child2 </>`. For more info, check [ReactJS' docs on Fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html). Note that we currently don't support:

- Keyed fragment.
- Fragment with ref.
- Fragment spread (ReasonReact-specific): `<> ...children </>`.

The latter will be supported next. **Fragment requires React 16**.

Additionally, DOM component children spread `<div>...foo</div>` now works. No more need to use the `ReasonReact.createDomElement` fallback!

## Removal of Previously Deprecated Features

- The DOM props `_type`, `_open`, and others (see 0.4.2 release notes below) are officially removed. Use `type_`, `open_`, etc.
- The field `subscriptions` was deprecated and is now removed completely. Please use the new [subscriptions helper](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/subscriptions-helper) instead.
- `ReasonReact.stringToElement`, `nullElement`, `arrayToElement` are also gone for good. Use `ReasonReact.string`, `null`, `array`. The previous migration script in `0.4.0` already took care of this.
- `ReasonReact.Callback` module removed.

## Deprecations

- `ReasonReact.createDomElement` is changed in favor of `ReactDOMRe.createElementVariadic`. This is more consistent with `ReactDOMRe.createElement`. Both are used by the JSX transform; the latter, when it's a children spread for DOM elements (mentioned above) and has a small perf cost.

Thanks for the wait, and enjoy!

# 0.4.2

**This release requires `bs-platform 3.1.4`**.

- DOM components now support `aria-*` attributes without needing hacks: `<div ariaLabel="foo" />`. The camelCase `ariaStuff` will compile to `aria-stuff`.
- For DOM props, instead of `_open`, `_type`, `_begin`, `_end`, `_in`, `_to`, use the new trailing underscore version for consistency: `open_`, `type_`, etc. The former leading underscore versions are now **deprecated**.

# 0.4.1

- Restore `ReasonReact.Callback` module for now and put a deprecation warning on it. This way, at least your third-party dependencies can compile further.
- Relax `wrapJsForReason` and `wrapReasonForJs` types so that we can use `bs.abstract` for interop instead of `Js.t` objects.

# 0.4.0

**Requires** bs-platform `>=3.0.0`. Migration script is [here](https://github.com/chenglou/upgrade-reason-react).

## Breaking Changes
- Remove `SilentUpdate` and `SilentUpdateWithSideEffects`. These aren't used for a long time now.
- `didMount` now returns `unit`, per our previous warnings in the docs. To trigger a state update, use `self.send(MyAction)`.
- Remove `self.reduce` for real; use `self.send` (not to be confused with `reducer`, which is still around).
- Remove `ReasonReact.Callback` module (undocumented and unused).

## Deprecations
- `ReasonReact.stringToElement`, `arrayToElement` and `nullElement` are now **deprecated** in favor of `ReasonReact.string`, `array` and `null`!
- **Old `subscriptions` API is deprecated**. Please use the new `self.onUnmount`.
- `willReceiveProps` deprecated. We'll transition to React 16 very soon and release our binding to `deriveStateFromProps`.

## Improvements
- Use `bool` instead of `Js.boolean` (thanks to BuckleScript 3.0.0).
- Fix Router incompatibility with IE11 (#201).
- Much more streamlined internals.
- Prepare to transition to React 16.
- **Did we mention** that `ReasonReact.stringToElement` is now `ReasonReact.string`, etc.?

# 0.3.4

This release **requires** bs-platform 2.2.2! If your app haven't upgraded to it, don't worry; you can still use ResonReact 0.3.2 just fine. Only two small changes.

- Use the new bs-platform `Js.Nullable.toOption`. No more deprecation warnings when you use ReasonReact (main purpose of the release).
- Add `ReactDOMRe.hydrate`, `hydrateToElementWithId`, `hydrateToElementWithClassName` (#184).

# 0.3.2

- Portal support (#152)
- Add `Router.dangerouslyGetInitialUrl`. Please see the corresponding docs on router.

# 0.3.1

No breaking change. **The migration script is [here](https://github.com/chenglou/upgrade-reason-react)**.

- New [subscriptions helper](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/subscriptions-helper.html).
- [**Router** is here](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/router.html)!
- `self.reduce` is now changed into `self.send`, with a simpler semantic that clears up the confusion on the immediate call case. More performant and fewer allocations too! The migration script will convert most of the code over for you.

Before: `onClick={self.reduce(_event => Click)}`
After: `onClick={_event => self.send(Click)}`

Before: `didMount: self => {self.reduce(() => Click, ()); NoUpdate}`
After: `didMount: self => {self.send(Click); NoUpdate}`

# 0.3.0

Technically a breaking change, but just because of the removal of a few deprecated things. **No migration script this time**; since the few breaking changes you encounter (if any) should have be spotted by the type system and fixed in a few secs anyway.

Improvements:

- **Loosen `children`'s restriction**. This unlocks _huge_ potentials. See the [blog post](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/blog/2017/11/17/power-children.html)!
- Fix a bug where side effects inside side effects were skipped (#98).
- React 16 support.
- All files upper-cased. This follows the [new community idiom](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/project-structure.html#file-casing). Technically an internal change; doesn't affect your usage of ReasonReact.
- More DOM props. There are like, more DOM props added per year than the number of releases we have. What a funny time to be alive.

Breaking Changes:

- **`ref` is now typed as `Js.nullable(Dom.element)`, not `Js.null(Dom.element)`**. `Js.nullable` is the new community idiom from BuckleScript. Go through your codebase and change your `state.myRef := Js.Null.to_opt(theRef)` into `state.myRef := Js.Nullable.to_opt(theRef)`. We suggest you to also remove all mentions of `Js.null`, `Js.undefined`, `Js.Null` and `Js.Undefined`. `Js.Nullable` checks for both JavaScript `null` and `undefined`, thus making the JS interop more robust. In the past, people type certain values (especially js objects fields) as e.g. `null` and forget they can be `undefined`.
- DOM components (`ReactDOMRe`)'s `open`, `end` and `in` attributes are now changed to `_open`, `_end` and `_in` to avoid using reserved keywords. This is only breaking if you're using these attributes _and_ are on the old syntax.
- Remove old stuff: `enqueue`, `statefulComponent` and `self.update`. These have long been deprecated.

# 0.2.4

**Major update**, but again with **no** breaking changes, and _again_ with a convenience [migration script](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/main/migrate/from02xTo024.js)! =)

The big change in this release is the deprecation of `statefulComponent` and `statefulComponentWithRetainedProps`. `statelessComponent` stays the same.

## Prerequisites

**Please first read the [blog post](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/blog.html#reducers-are-here)**.

**After** reading this migration guide, use the migration script (or not) like so: `node node_modules/reason-react/migrate/from02xTo024.js myReasonFile.re`.

## Migrate From StatefulComponent to ReducerComponent

There's no more need for `ReasonReact.statefulComponent`. Every state change is now controlled through a dedicated, centralized, react-fiber-ready, component-local mechanism called "reducer" (aka, the hype word for "state machine").

[Reason-react-example](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example) is updated too. Go check the examples afterward!

In short:

- Replace all `ReasonReact.statefulComponent` with `ReasonReact.reducerComponent`.
- Replace e.g. `self.update handleClick` (where `handleClick` is `fun self => ReasonReact.Update {...self.state, foo: bar}`) with `self.reduce (fun _ => Click)`. `Click` is just a variant constructor you've defined. Let's call it "action".
- Add a `reducer` function to the body of your `...component` spread:

```reason
reducer: fun action state =>
  switch action {
  | Click => ReasonReact.Update {...state, foo: bar}
  }
```

We've also exposed new `ReasonReact.SideEffects` (aka `ReasonReact.NoUpdate`, with side-effect) and `ReasonReact.UpdateWithSideEffects` (`ReasonReact.Update` + side-effect).

The relevant section on actions, reducers and the new update additions are [in the main docs](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/state-actions-reducer.html).

**If everything goes alright, we will be deprecating `statefulComponent` in the future**

## InstanceVars/React Ref Usage Changed

Before, we used to recommend using `ReasonReact.SilentUpdate` to deal with ReactJS' instance variables pattern (e.g. attaching properties onto the component class itself, like timer IDs, subscriptions, refs, etc.). Now we've moved to using a Reason `ref` cell (not the React ref, the [mutative Reason `ref`](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/mutation.html)). See the updated [instance variables section](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/instance-variables.html).

The new recommendation also solves a corner-case bug with assigning more than one refs in the render.

## LifeCycle: Future `didMount` and `willReceiveProps` Signature Change

The future ReactJS Fiber in ReasonReact won't work well with lifecycle events that return the new state, aka:

- `didMount`'s `ReasonReact.Update {...state, foo: bar}`
- `willReceiveProps` `state`.

Please return `ReasonReact.NoUpdate` for the former (can't do much for the latter, `willReceiveProps`, for now. Keep it as it is). If you really need to trigger a state change, before the return, use a `self.reduce (fun () => Bar) ()`, aka immediately apply a reduce.

**We will make all lifecycles return `unit` in the future; it'll be an easy codemod to change `ReasonReact.NoUpdate` to nothing**.

## Miscellaneous Changes

- Add `defaultChecked`, `loop` and others to DOM attribute (#29, #37, #44, #50).
- Fix `cloneElement` binding (#49).
- Fix stateless components's `willReceiveProps`'s return value. It's now `unit` again.
- Fix wrong version of `retainedProps` in `willReceiveProps`.
- Remove the dependency on `create-react-class`. Now we're back to being dependency-free!
- Bump react/react-dom to 16.
- React/react-dom are now dependencies, rather than peerDependencies. This follows the Reason/BS idiom of making the bound library an implementation detail. NPM/Yarn will still dedupe multiple versions of react/react-dom correctly; no worries about that.

Enjoy!

# 0.2.1

Breaking update (sorry!)

**We've finally removed `ReactRe`**. It's been deprecated since 0.1.4. And we've offered a comprehensive migration in the 0.1.4 section below.

We've given folks a bit of breathing room in terms of breaking changes; now we're shipping another one, this time with a small migration script. **After installing reason-react**, use `node node_modules/reason-react/oldScriptCarefulMigrateFrom015To020.js myReasonFile.re`

- Instead of `fun state self => ...`, we've now rolled `state` into `self`, and now, you have `fun {state, handle} => ...`. The whole record is `self`. Feel free to destructure and get whatever you need!
- `self` now contains a new prop, `retainedProps`. This is a new (non-breaking) feature that solves the previous slightly inconvenient way of forwarding props to state, as described in the old API's lifecycle methods. Now there's a dedicated API for it! The docs describes this in detail.

# 0.1.5

Non-breaking update. Works better with bs-platform >=1.8.0, which comes with the following ReasonReact JSX fixes:

- JSX ppx now recursively transforms component's props.
- JSX ppx now reports the correct location for some errors.
- JSX ppx now correctly transforms some corner case with ref and key (`ref=?foo`).

Our own release contains the following improvements:

- Adjust ReactDOMRe's `props` and `style` to include more accurate DOM and style attributes and styles (#9, #15, #17).
- Add `ReactDOMRe.Style.unsafeAddProp` to unsafely add a prop to an existing `style`. Make sure you know what you're doing!
- Fix `reactRef`'s type in various locations. A React ref is actually always nullable; we've previously only acknowledged it for DOM ref, now we do for custom (composite) components ref too. A more detailed explanation is [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9328#issuecomment-298438237). This is documented in our docs in the ref section as well.
- Add `cloneElement` (solves adding otherwise invalid keys like aria-label and data-foo).
- Add `shouldUpdate`.

# 0.1.4

Major update! Though this is 100% backward compatible, so no major version bump. We've revamped the whole API based on all you awesome folks' feedback, and we've provided a gradual migration path.

## Requirements & Self-Congratulations
- New BuckleScript. bs-platform >=1.7.5
- This repo. reason-react >=0.1.4

Upon installing the new dependencies, **your existing code still works**. Isn't that great? You can incrementally convert things over. The old modules will stay around until the next or next next version. No rush!

`ReactDOMRe`, `ReactDOMServerRe` and `ReactEventRe` stay as-is. `ReactRe` is now deprecated (but again, is staying around) in favor of the new implementation, `ReasonReact`.

Small overview:

- No more modules/functors needed for the API (don't go crazy with the new function composition power please!)
- No more `include`
- 10-20% smaller code on average, both input and output
- Corner-cases with `children` and empty props mostly gone
- **Unused props now warn**

## Forwarded Definitions
The following definitions are carried over from `ReactRe` into `ReasonReact`, unchanged. A simple search-and-replace fixes all of them:

- `ReactRe.reactElement` -> `ReasonReact.reactElement`
- like wise, `reactClass`
- `reactRef`, `refToJsObj`
- `nullElement`, `stringToElement`, `arrayToElement`
- `createElement` (if you recall, this isn't the pervasive ReactJS `React.createElement`). It's only used raw in escape hatch situations. If you've never used it: great!

## JSX
Lowercase JSX `<div> whatever </div>` didn't change. Uppercase `<Foo ref=a key=b bar=baz> hello goodbye </Foo>` used to translate to `Foo.createElement ref::a key::b bar::baz [hello, goodbye]`. It now translates to `ReasonReact.element ref::a key::b (Foo.make bar::baz [|hello, goodbye|])`. We've pulled out `ref` and `key` into a dedicated call for good measures, and instead of using list as children, we now use array. More idiomatic ReactJS, list <-> array conversion churn.

To use the new JSX, change `bsconfig.json`'s `{"reason": {"react-jsx": true}}` to `{"reason": {"react-jsx": 2}}`. **Although you probably won't do that at the beginning**, since that'd change all JSX in the whole project and cause type errors everywhere. Instead, keep your old `bsconfig.json` unchanged and for the JSX you'd like to selectively convert over, put a `[@@@bs.config {jsx: 2}];` at the top of the file. Once you've converted everything over, switch to `{"react-jsx": 2}` in `bsconfig.json` and remove those `@@@bs.config` at the top of every file.

Alternatively, you can go straight to `{"react-jsx": 2}` in `bsconfig.json`, and put a `[@@@bs.config {jsx: 1}]` at the top of files where you'd like to use the old uppercase JSX transform.

**Before starting the sections below**, please briefly go through the new API on the documentation page.

## `Foo.createElement` (Jargon Change)
_Not to be confused with the `ReactRe.createElement` in the previous section_.

`Foo.createElement` is now referred to as `Foo.make`. `make` is a more idiomatic term in Reason/OCaml, and is shorter to type!

## `componentBag`
The concept of `componentBag` is now called `self`. We thought it'd be a more appropriate name. The new `self` doesn't contain `props`, `state`, `setState` and `instanceVars` anymore; these are no longer needed in the new ReasonReact.

### `componentBag.props`
Replaced with the new `make` (previously `createElement`) call which takes in labeled arguments. See more in [this section](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/creation-props-self.html).

How to access `props` in the `update`/`handle` callbacks now? You'd move these callback definitions into the `make` function body.

### `componentBag.state`
Now passed to you as an argument in callbacks and lifecycle events.

### `componentBag.instanceVars`
No longer needed. In ReactJS, attaching instance variables onto a component has always been a sly way of introducing 1. mutative state that 2. doesn't trigger re-render. This whole concept is now replaced by putting your value into `state` and using [`ReasonReact.SilentUpdate`](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/callback-handlers.html) (doesn't trigger re-render, but does update state) in callbacks & lifecycles.

### `componentBag.setState`
Not to be confused with the ReactJS `setState` you often use (though if you're reading this migration guide, you probably know this already). This was an escape hatch designed for times when you can't, for example, return an `option state` from an `updater`, because you want to `setState` imperatively and asynchronously. The new idiom is to just use `self.update myhandler ()`. Notice `update myhandler` returns a callback just like before, but now you're immediately applying the callback.

### `updater`/`handler`
`updater` and `handler` are now called `update` and `handle`. They should be an easy search-and-replace.

The return type of `update`, instead of `option state`, is now `update state`.

The signature of the callback they take has changed. Instead of e.g. `updater (fun {props, state, instanceVars} event => Some {...state, foo: true})`, it's now `update (fun event state self => ReasonReact.Update {...state, foo: true})`. Formal, simplified type of the new callback: `payload => state => self => update state`.

`update` and `handle` don't memoize anymore; this reduces confusion and potential memory leaks.

## Render
`render`, previously in your component module, is now inside `make`. See the example [here](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/intro-example.html).

## Ref & Other Mutable Instance Variables
`ref` now lives inside state, as described in `componentBag.instanceVars` just above. Instead of `componentBag.handler`+ mutating `instanceVars`, you'd now use `update` and returning `ReasonReact.SilentUpdate {...state, ref: theRef}`. `ref`s and others probably default to `None` in your initial state.

## Lifecycles

We've decided to finally drop the `component` prefix to lifecycle methods! `componentDidMount` is now just called `didMount`, etc. The signatures changed slightly; see them in the new [lifecycle events section](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/lifecycles.html).

## Children
The children helpers & types `reactJsChildren`, `listToElement` and `jsChildrenToReason` are all gone from `ReasonReact`, since we now use array instead of list.

## New Reason <-> JS Interop

### `wrapPropsShamelessly` (Reason Calling JS)
It's not clear why we called it this way in the old API. Please tell @_chenglou that he should name things more seriously on a serious project. The new name is `wrapJsForReason`. The signature hasn't changed much; arguments are labeled now and explicitly accept an unlabeled `children` at the last position. Example:

Before:

```reason
external myJSReactClass : ReasonReact.reactClass = "myJSReactClass" [@@bs.module];

let createElement name::(name: string) age::(age: option int)=? =>
  ReactRe.wrapPropsShamelessly myJSReactClass {"name": name, "age": Js.Nullable.from_opt age};
```

After:

```reason
external myJSReactClass : ReasonReact.reactClass = "myJSReactClass" [@@bs.module];

let make name::(name: string) age::(age: option int)=? children =>
  ReasonReact.wrapJsForReason
    reactClass::myJSReactClass
    props::{"name": name, "age": Js.Nullable.from_opt age}
    children;
```

**Don't forget** that once these are converted over, the callsites of these components will need to use the new JSX transform described above. Otherwise they'll generate type errors.

### `jsPropsToReasonProps` (JS Calling Reason)
Now called `wrapReasonForJs`. The file-level `include` that served this interop is gone; it used to magically export the backing component `comp` for JS consumption. You now have to manually export `comp` through the new `wrapReasonForJs`. Continuation of the previous example:

```reason
let component = ...;
let make ...;

let comp =
  ReasonReact.wrapReasonForJs
    ::component
    (fun jsProps => make name::jsProps##name age::?(Js.Nullable.to_opt jsProps##age) [||]);
```

The function takes in the labeled reason `component`, and a function that, given the js props, asks you to call `make` while passing in the correctly converted parameters.

**Aaaand that's it**! Enjoy!

# 0.1.3
DOM ref is now typed as `Js.null Dom.element`, instead of just `Dom.element` (https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/commit/6f2a75b). Trivial migration: https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example/commit/b44587a

# 0.1.2
Add `defaultValue` prop for input DOM component (https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/commit/c293c6e)

# 0.1.1
Correct type of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (#76)

# 0.1.0
Lots of great people working together.
